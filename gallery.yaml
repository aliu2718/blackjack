# Description of the project.
desc: >
  Our project is an interactive single-player Blackjack game. It simulates a 
  classic "no hole card", "non-soft 17" Blackjack game that supports traditional 
  player decisions such as hitting, standing, doubling down, splitting, and
  surrendering as well as a betting mechanism to create a thrilling risk/reward
  experience.
  
  The user interface of the Blackjack game is fully text-based, and players can
  interact with the the interface by typing specific commands in the terminal.
  The game also offers an assistance tool that suggests the recommended action
  to take, which is based on statistics derived from the current game state as
  well as widely known Blackjack strategies.
